# Support Directory

## Description
Contains the Support area of the repo under `triage/chordinate/Sources/Chordinate/Support` inside Dinglehopper. Use cases focus on maintaining or extending the responsibilities assigned to this directory.

## Manifesto
- Treat `triage/chordinate/Sources/Chordinate/Support` as the authoritative home for the Support area of the repo and keep changes scoped to that intent.
- Document how the contents interact with the rest of Dinglehopper so future contributors can understand the workflows.
- Keep clarity, accessibility, and reliability high so this area continues to support its use cases over time.
